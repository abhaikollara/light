# light
An simple interpreter written in Python

## Language description
Will add it soon

## Example usage
Run `python repl.py`

```
>>> let x = 3
>>> let add_two = func(x){ return x + 2 } # This is how function declaration works
>>> add_two(x)
5
```

## TODO
- [ ] Figure out how to make closures work
- [ ] Grouped expressions
- [ ] Implement builtins
  - [ ] Implement `print`
- [ ] Implement strings, floats as datatypes
